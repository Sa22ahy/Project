# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using clinical data. By employing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques, the project aims to enhance early-stage CKD detection and improve healthcare outcomes.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identification of key clinical features influencing CKD prediction.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, and Logistic Regression.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessment using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python Libraries: Install them using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install ucimlrepo pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sa22ahy
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
